## The pan-European format
Aside from its technical advantages and its easy handling, FundsXML is becoming the pan-European format, allowing B2B and B2C activity in the mutual fund sector. The development of this standard was pushed by various companies to integrate numerous working processes in the sector, enclosing the foundation of a fund and the system of registration as well as the electronic data exchange, beyond the borders of companies and countries.
FundsXML is already used in the following countries:

					
- AT

- DE

- NL

## FundsXML is a powerful XML standard format for easy exchange of fund related data between:
- Asset Managers
